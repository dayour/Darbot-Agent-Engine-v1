# Darbot Project - Summary and Status

## Overview

This document summarizes the extensive work completed on the **Darbot** multi-agent custom automation engine solution accelerator. It covers the key components, configuration, Azure integration, troubleshooting steps, and current status.

---

## Project Components

- **Backend**  
  Python-based backend located in `src/backend/` implementing core logic, Azure AI integration, and Cosmos DB connectivity.

- **Azure AI Integration**  
  Utilizes Azure AI Project SDK (`azure.ai.projects.aio`) for managing AI projects and agents.  
  Azure OpenAI services are integrated for advanced language model capabilities.

- **Cosmos DB**  
  Azure Cosmos DB is used for storing plans and other persistent data.

- **Configuration**  
  Environment variables are managed via a `.env` file in the backend folder, containing Azure resource identifiers, endpoints, keys, and authentication credentials.

## Key Changes and Steps Taken

### 1. Azure SDK Installation and Module Resolution

- Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'azure'` by installing the required Azure SDK packages.
- Verified Python environment and dependencies to ensure Azure SDK modules are available.

### 2. Environment Configuration Validation

- Validated `.env` file contents for correctness and completeness.
- Identified missing `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` which is critical for Azure Active Directory authentication.
- Explained the need for Azure App Registration to obtain `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for secure OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication.

### 3. Azure Authentication Setup

- Guided on how to create or locate an Azure AD App Registration in the Azure Portal.
- Explained why app registration is necessary for secure access to Azure resources beyond static keys.
- Emphasized best practices for managing credentials securely in environment variables.

### 4. Endpoint and Credential Verification

- Confirmed all Azure service endpoints (AI Project, OpenAI, Cosmos DB) are correctly set in `.env`.
- Ensured subscription IDs, tenant IDs, resource group names, and project names are consistent and valid.

---

## Current Status

- **Backend code** is functional with Azure SDK dependencies resolved.
- **Authentication** requires completion by setting valid `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`.
- **Azure resources** are correctly referenced but require proper credentials for successful connection.
- **Cosmos DB** connection details are configured and ready for use.
- **OpenAI integration** is set up with deployment and model names specified.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Azure App Registration Setup**  
   - Create or use existing Azure AD App Registration.  
   - Obtain and securely store Client ID and Client Secret in `.env`.

2. **Test Authentication and Connectivity**  
   - Run backend to verify successful token acquisition and service calls.

3. **Implement Additional Features**  
   - Expand multi-agent orchestration logic.  
   - Add unit tests and integration tests for Azure service interactions.

4. **Deployment Preparation**  
   - Follow Azure deployment best practices for backend services.  
   - Securely manage secrets using Azure Key Vault or managed identities.
